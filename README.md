# Image-Classification-and-Segmentation

The primary objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras, we build Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify images from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2019 Challenge dataset. This dataset is known for its diverse range of dermatological conditions, presenting a challenging yet promising opportunity to delve into the intricacies of image classification. Although it has images belonging to 8 different classes, we just randomly choose 2 for the classes: Melanoma and Basal cell carcinoma (BCC).
The model designed by combination of CNN and Transfer learning mentioned here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9121248 shows an accuracy of 94% which is higher than what we were able to achieve with a simple CNN model.

For image segmentation: we explore the application of image segmentation using a pre-trained Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model obtained from torchvision.models. With the growing exploration of Artifical Intelligence , there are several open source model that we can utilize and fine tune for our needs. Specifically, this model, Mask R-CNN with a ResNet-50 backbone and feature pyramid network (FPN), is loaded with pre-trained weights, enabling us to leverage its learned features and capabilities for segmenting images.
